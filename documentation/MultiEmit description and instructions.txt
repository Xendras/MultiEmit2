MultiEmit
Jonas Westerlund, 2017

Description
MultiEmit is a web-based results management application centered around the electronic EMIT-systems. 
The EMIT-cards and punches are widely used in orienteering and multisports to authenticate that the competitors 
have visited the required points during the competition. The system tries to emulate roughly what happens when 
a EMIT-card is registered at multiple controls and then read in the results service. More detailed information on the 
EMIT-systems can be found on the webpage, unfortunately only in Finnish: https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emit.

User instructions
The application requires a login with correct credentials. Currently the application only has two user accounts. 
These are username:admin password: admin, and username:user password:user. The admin account has full privileges 
for editing and viewing. The user account has only viewing privileges and no access to the Emit-pages.
The application is divided into three major parts: the competitions, the competitors, and the EMIT-cards. Each 
competition consists of a name, location, and date. Each competitor has a name, club, and an unique EMIT-card. Each 
EMIT-card can only have one owner at one time. This makes it possible to identify each competitor by their EMIT-number. 
Each EMIT-card has a unique number, and a list of successful EmitPunches at different controls. Each EmitPunch contains 
the code of the control as well as a timestamp.

Services and functions
The following services are central to the result application:
-	Adding, viewing, and removing competitors
-	Adding, viewing, and removing competitions
-	Adding, viewing and removing EMIT-cards
-	Editing the content of the EMIT-cards (EmitPunches)
-	Adding competitors to different competitions
-	Adding results to competitions based on the contents of a competitors EMIT-card
-	Associating a competitor with an existing EMIT-card

Services and functions not implemented
The following services and functions were unfortunately not implemented:
-	Sorting the list of competition results by final time
-	Giving better headings for result lists, more of a formatting question. For example the results list is not very informative.
-	Adding a control list to competitions which validates a result by a competitor. If there are controls missing the result will be marked as disqualified.
-	Giving the admin a possibility of adding more user accounts.
-	Setting special rules for missing controls for special competitions
-	List-based inputs for entering many EmitPunches to an EMIT-card at once. It is unclear what the data really looks like on an EMIT-card, so preparing for that is difficult.
